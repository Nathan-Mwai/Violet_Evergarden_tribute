            <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a timeline of Violet Evergarden's life</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1917: </strong>Violet Evergarden, a young girl with no emotions but exceptional combat skills, enlists in the Leidenschaftlich Army during the Great War. Her life takes a drastic turn as she becomes a weapon of war, devoid of feelings or understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>1918:</strong>Violet, a soldier under Major Gilbert Bougainvillea, has a complex relationship with him. Gilbert treats her as a tool, yet an underlying connection exists. On the battlefield, Violet’s unmatched combat abilities lead to severe injuries, including the loss of her arms. After the war, she receives prosthetic arms but grapples with her purpose—no longer a soldier, yet not quite human.</li>
                <li><Strong>1919:</Strong> Violet Evergarden, a former soldier, becomes an Auto Memories Doll who transcribes emotions into letters, connects with clients, and learns about love, compassion, and redemption. Her reunion with Major Gilbert brings closure and reveals the depth of his feelings for her. </li>
                <li><strong>1920:</strong> Violet grapples with the enigma of Major Gilbert’s fate. His return was both a blessing and a burden—she yearns for answers about his disappearance during the war.Violet encounters a grieving widow who seeks solace through letters. As she transcribes the woman’s memories of love and loss, Violet reflects on her own journey of healing. </li>
                <li><strong>1921:</strong> Violet, an Auto Memories Doll, grapples with the enigma of Major Gilbert’s fate. Along her path, she encounters a grieving widow, writes for a renowned composer, and reflects on her own growth. Her pilgrimage to Leiden unearths old acquaintances and buried memories. An unsent letter reveals unrequited love, and on a snowy Christmas Eve, Violet discovers the magic of music that bridges gaps between souls. Additionally, she receives a request from a young pianist, transcribing his compositions and finding solace in the melodies. </li>
                <li><strong>1922:</strong> Violet, an Auto Memories Doll, faces her toughest task: writing a farewell letter for a terminally ill client. In her words, the weight of mortality and the beauty of fleeting moments collide. Violet grapples with existence’s fragility, realizing that sometimes, the most profound letters are those that say goodbye. Farewells may not be an end but a transformation—a shift from ink to memory.

                    At her journey’s crossroads, Violet has learned to feel, connect, and write her own story. As spring arrives, she embraces life’s uncertainties with newfound courage. Like cherry blossoms, she unfurls her petals—a testament to resilience and growth. Perhaps seasons mirror our transformations, and every ending births a new beginning. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="quote-3"><i>"In the quiet moments between ink and paper, we find our truest selves. Letters become bridges, connecting hearts across time and distance. And within those words, we discover the magic of empathy—the power to heal, to love, and to create everlasting memories."</i></p>
